Hi, I'm Daniele 👋  
Electronic Engineer with a strong interest in applied engineering, automation, and intelligent systems.

My work mainly focuses on:
- Embedded systems and electronics
- Signal and data processing
- Computer Vision and AI applied to industrial and robotic scenarios
- Robotics and automation systems

Most of my development activity happens in private repositories, as it is related to research projects, industrial work, or NDA-covered applications.

Here you can find:
- Public experiments, tools, and utilities
- Technical demos and side projects
- Selected code samples related to my interests

Always interested in projects that combine hardware, software, and real-world constraints.
